## 2026-06-01 - Prevented O(N^2) Rendering in Streaming Components
**Learning:** React state arrays that update frequently (like appending chunks to streaming text) cause full list re-renders. This is an O(N^2) performance bottleneck, especially in long chat threads.
**Action:** Always wrap list items in `React.memo()` when rendering frequently updated arrays, especially in streaming applications like DSP Bus chat messages.
