**Learning:** Icon-only utility buttons in the governor UI lacked both semantic labels and keyboard focus indicators, making them completely inaccessible to keyboard and screen reader users.
**Action:** Ensure all icon buttons include explicit `title` (for mouse), `aria-label` (for screen readers), and `focus-visible` styling (matching hover context, e.g., `gov-error` for destructive actions) for keyboard navigation.
