//! Sparse attention with topology-derived key selection — CPU reference.
//!
//! This is a reference implementation, not a fast kernel. It exists so the
//! correctness contracts in `tests/attention_contracts.rs` have something to
//! bind to, and so the same-budget ablation can be run at all. There is no GPU
//! path in this workspace; a fast kernel needs one, and claiming a speedup
//! without it would be measuring nothing.
//!
//! What it does provide:
//!
//!   - `dense_attention`: ordinary scaled dot-product attention, the reference
//!     every sparse path is checked against.
//!   - `sparse_attention`: the same computation restricted to a boolean mask,
//!     with an explicit guard for rows that select nothing.
//!   - `Selector`: the key-selection rules, including the topological one and the
//!     three baselines an honest evaluation needs.
//!   - `attention_mass_recovered`: the diagnostic that says whether topology did
//!     the work or sparsity did.
//!
//! No backward pass. When one is added, a `gradcheck` against the dense path on
//! the same mask is the first test that must accompany it: a forward-correct
//! kernel with a wrong backward trains to a plausible worse optimum, which loss
//! curves alone will not reveal.
